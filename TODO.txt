Remove Parser#next for VALUEs representing a pure String!

Do not cache the encoding for Tag and Length. This should 
perform better on average. Still, put the current implementation
in a separate branch, if it should be needed in the future.

DefiniteInputStream and ChunkedInputStream: Respect the boundaries
on a skip.
